# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

# Project Overview

- In this project, I was given a debugging task to prevent users from adding the same goal more than once.

# Project Brief

- The goal was to prevent users from adding duplicate fitness goals to the list.
- I had to check if the goal being added already exists in the list before appending it.
- I had to display an alert to inform the user if they try to add a duplicate goal.
- I had to focus on the code structure within the function and how to handle duplicates.

# Elements Included

- JavaScript modifications that prevent dupolicate fitness goals from being added to the list.
- GitHub repository that has the updated index.js file.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

In this project there wasn't any specific area of mastery that I could point at because there's still so much I believe I need to learn regarding JavaScript.

## Challenges faced

- One of the challenges I faced was the actual debugging of the code that prevents duplication on the list. I was not able to figure out the required function that 'returns' the text in the input field.

## Areas for Improvement

- Ability to debug and manipulate code.

### Overall Learning Experience

- Using different codes to test the project to ensure that validation works correctly under the condition I wanted was a bit overwhelming. I got to learn that debugging is also part of the learning process. I should actually give "Testing and Debugging" more practice.
